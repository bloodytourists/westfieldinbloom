            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>Westfield was originally exactly that, an area of farms west of Radstock on the Fosse Way, stretching 
                            along the Roman highway. It was built in a AD49 to link Exeter to Saint Albans and later to London and Lincoln.</p> 
                        <p>The A367 remains an arterial Road but the original Road took a diversion to avoid the swamp in the middle of Radstock 
                            and re-emerged behind Methodist Church. Some stretches can still be seen.</p>
                        <p>Everything changed when Coal began to be mined commercially from 1763, with two major collieries being developed at Norton 
                            hill (a scene of a terrible mine disaster in 1908 which led to modern safety measures such as the Davy lamp) and at the Wellsway.</p> 
                        <p>Bath College, on the site of the mines' manager's mansion was founded in 1947 to train local young people to work in the mines 
                            and on the farms. Today it is IT!</p>
                        <p>All the mines were closed by 1973 but much of the wellsway mine can still be seen in a small industrial estate, while Norton 
                            hill disappeared under housing developments, although its railway station is now a heritage museum.</p>
                        <p>Manufacturing units also left, with only one large print company remaining. The parish council produced a neighbourhood plan 
                            after much consultation with residents in 2015-17. One aim was to maintain as much employment land as possible since at present 
                            60% of residents have to out commute to Bristol bath or Shepton Mallet.</p>
                        <p>The parish council, having recently declared a climate emergency and taking green issues very seriously indeed, endeavour to 
                            educate residents in the issues and have purchased this year three fields along the Riverside with the intention of developing 
                            major trails and conservation projects.</p>
                        <p>One distinctive feature of the area is the batch heaps of coal waste which have rewilded and have been planted with trees to 
                            stabilise them. They have to be checked annually against slippage since water is flowing out of the disused mines.</p>
                        <p>In 2011 Westfield parish council was created under the terms of the local government act. There were approximately 5063 adults 
                            on the electoral roll but the publication of the 2021 census result will give a better indication of numbers, given how many of 
                            the once substantial Polish community in Westport have returned home. There are 11 councillors on the parish council and two 
                            unitary authority councillors. There is a clerk and assistant to whom the community to whom the community are much indebted 
                            for the smooth administration of the recreation grounds.</p>
